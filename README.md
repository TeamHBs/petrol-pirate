## Description

Petrol Pirate is an app where users may sign-in/sign-up and then view and submit low gas prices. When a user starts the application, they are presented a login page. Exisitng users can input their credentials and login; new users can input their information to add a new user to the database. When a user logs in, they are presented with the homepage showing the stations and prices along with a map showing a pin on each station. A user can choose a filter from a dropdown, input a value to filter on, and the table/map will then update to only show prices that pass the filter. A user can choose to submit a new price by clicking the button on the nav bar at the top of the page. On the submission page, a user is presented a form to fill out with the desired information. When a user submits the form and the address is not extant in the database, it will add the user's input to the database as a new price. If the user submits an address that already exists in the database, it will update that price in the database. After submission, a user is returned to the homepage with a notification of successfully adding/updating a price.
